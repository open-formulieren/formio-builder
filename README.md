# Formio builder for Open Forms

:construction: WIP Formio.js builder :construction:

Storybook: https://open-formulieren.github.io/formio-builder/

## TODO

- [ ] Formio used tooltip.js, which used to be popper.js (?), which points to tippy.js. That seems
      to point to Floating UI, however there is a https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs-react.

- [ ] Check possible react-select accessibility concerns

- [ ] Figure out component-specific documentation/instructions

- [ ] Add storybook test runner & run the stories/play functions in CI
