# Open Forms Formio builder

This package contains the (WIP) formio builder replacement, using React + Formik for more
declarative and easier-to-extend form builder configuration.

It is not meant to be a full featured vanilla Formio builder replacement, but aims only to serve the
needs for Open Forms.

## How to use this Storybook

This storybook is meant as a development tool and reference for the available components. For the
time being, the styles used are still bootstrap 4.5 styles, but with the pending re-design this will
likely change.
