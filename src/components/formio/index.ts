/**
 * A (limited and opinionated) re-implementation of Formio component types as React
 * components.
 *
 * Use these components only for the builder interface!
 *
 * Currently they apply the Bootstrap styles like the upstream builder, but this is
 * subject to change. Note that we also deliberately "leak" Open Forms specifics into
 * these components - after all, the raison d'Ãªtre of this library is to make the Open
 * Forms' codebase easier to maintain and tweak.
