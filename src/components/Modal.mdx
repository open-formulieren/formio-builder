# Modals

Modals are built with the `react-modal` library, which helps enforce the accessible behaviours.

Pass the content of the modal as children:

```tsx
<Modal isOpen closeModal={() => setClosed()}>
  <h1>Modal title</h1>
  <p>Modal body</p>
</Modal>
```

## Props

<ArgTypes />

## Context

For Storybook purposes, we use the `ModalContext` React context so that the nodes are injected in
the correct location. The context is considered private API and it is not necessary to make use of
the modal component.
